          This awesome website was created in the semester of 2020-1 (January to June) by 2 mathematical engineers and 2 software
          engineers students from <a href={"http://www.eafit.edu.co/"}>EAFIT University</a> in Medell√≠n,
          Colombia.
        </p>
        <p>
          This website serves a double purpose:
          <ol>
            <li>
              Firstly, it is a platform for the students to turn in assignments to the professor, and for the professor
              to give feedback to the students in the form of comments.
            </li>
            <li>
              Secondly, it displays various numerical analysis methods seen in the course "Numerical Analysis - ST0256".
              Those are single variable solving methods, equations systems methods, interpolation methods. Also, methods
              used to solve differentiation and differential equations.
            </li>
          </ol>
